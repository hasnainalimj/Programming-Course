1) Return Multiple Documents
2) For getting all the documents for specified collection we use loop.

Doc():
1) For generate Specific own Id.
2) It accepts string value.

Set() (Specific):
1) If you want to generate your own id then we need to use set() method after define doc() with your own id.
2) Set() accepts object.

Get() Specific:

2) Then we used get() no need to use forEach cause it always get only a single document.
